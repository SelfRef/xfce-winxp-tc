# Fonts
This directory contains the Windows XP system fonts.

## Structure
This is just essentially a bin for fonts, the structure is as follows:

`ttf/` - contains the TrueType font files

## Developing
Should not need any further development in terms of additional fonts - these are all the fonts included with the RTM system.
