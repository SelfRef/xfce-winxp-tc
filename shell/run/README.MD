## Keyboard Shortcut
You can add `run` to a keyboard shortcut on `Win`+`R`/`super`+`R` as follows:
- Open *XFCE settings* (if using the Start menu, opening *Control Panel* will take you there)
- Open the *Keyboard* section
- Select the *Application Shortcuts* tab
- Click *Add* (bottom left)
- Type or browse for `/usr/bin/run`
- Press the keyboard combination you would like to bind it with (typically `Win`+`R` / `super`+`R`)

Once done you should be able to press the keyboard shortcut, and the Run dialog will appear in the bottom left as expected.
