# Bundled Programs
This directory contains source code for the various programs included with the system.

## Structure
The structure of each directory is that of a typical CMake project for building an application.

## /shell or /windows ?
There are details in the `/shell` directory `README` for determining whether a component belongs here or there. The short version is, if the program is not part of the shell (examples of shell programs: `explorer`, `shimgvw`) then it belongs in here.
