# Tools
This directory contains development tools for working on parts of the project.

## Structure
Each directory houses a tool or multiple tools related to a particular area of development. There is no strict layout to these tools, essentially you will be looking at mostly Bash/Python scripts and `README`s.

## Tooling areas
Here is a brief overview of each subdirectory:
- `locale` - contains tools for aiding in localization
- `bldutils` - contains tools used by CMake build processes
