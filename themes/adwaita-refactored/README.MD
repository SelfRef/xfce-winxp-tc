# Adwaita Refactored Reference Source
This directory contains a refactored version of *Adwaita*, the upstream GTK 3 theme ('the only one'). This is intended to be used as a reference only to assist with fixing theme bugs.

## Building
If you want to build this for some reason, just transpile `main.scss` with `sass` and use the output as your GTK3 theme. It should work, but there isn't much point!
